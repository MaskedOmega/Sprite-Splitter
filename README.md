# Sprite-Splitter

Working Progress 

v1
Currently is capable of taking a whole sprite sheet and saving idividual sprites in relative order based on position from left to right and then up to down

Future improvements add name specifics capable to take any naming system and store effective in relation to sprite

v2 
Added a directory load splitter save where a directory can be given it reads the format crates a copy of folder structure and then saves it to a desired location.
Added multi splitter where multiple sprites sheets can be individual processed and saved in correct folder format

Future improvements have a naming change to make all files in the specified directory follow a single standard allowing universal use
